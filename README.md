# Bellabeat-Capstone-Project

Welcome to the Bellabeat Capstone Project!

The Bellabeat Capstone Project is the final case study that I have done at the end of my Google Data Anlytics Certificate. 

In this project, I was presented a business problem and through data analysis, I have came up with my business recommendation for Bellabeat. For this particular case study, I used R programming language to do my analysis and at the end I used R markdown to created a report to documented my thinking and all of the steps that I have taken to arrived at my recommendation. 

The environment that was used for this project is RStudio.
